Transform Claude from a **reactive assistant** to a **proactive development partner** with real-time environmental intelligence. **Now with full Astro, Vite, Convex, and Turbo monorepo support!**

## 🤖 **For Claude Code Users**

**Transform Claude from reactive to proactive development partner:**

```bash
# 1. Install globally
npm install -g claude-autonomous-dev

# 2. Initialize in your project (run this once)
claude-auto init

# 3. Now Claude can intelligently check your environment
claude-auto status
```

### **How It Works with Claude Code**

**Claude Code can run terminal commands and see their output.** This package makes that **100x more powerful**:

**Before (Multiple blind commands):**
```
Claude: "Let me check your environment..."
→ Runs: ps aux | grep dev
→ Runs: curl localhost:3000  
→ Runs: npx tsc --noEmit
→ Runs: git status
→ Analyzes 4 separate outputs, may miss things
```

**After (Single intelligent command):**
```
Claude: "Let me check your environment..."
→ Runs: claude-auto status
→ Gets comprehensive structured data instantly
→ "I can see Vite on 5173, TypeScript clean, 3 files changed, ready to proceed"
```

### **What Claude Gains**
- ✅ **Instant Environment Intel**: Complete development state in one command
- ✅ **Proactive Problem Detection**: "I see TypeScript errors, fixing those first"
- ✅ **Framework Awareness**: "Detected Astro + Convex setup, adjusting workflow"
- ✅ **Process Monitoring**: "Dev server running on PID 12345, safe to proceed"
- ✅ **Auto-Fix Capabilities**: Can run `claude-auto fix` to resolve common issues
- ✅ **Real-Time Logs**: Stream Convex logs with `claude-auto logs convex --tail`

### **In Practice**
Claude doesn't "watch" your terminal continuously, but when it **does** check your environment during development sessions, it gets **vastly more intelligent and actionable information** from fewer commands.

**Result**: Claude makes **informed decisions** instead of guessing, leading to faster and more accurate development assistance.

## 🚀 The Revolution

### Before (Blind Development)
- ❌ "Can you check if the server is running?"
- ❌ "Are there any TypeScript errors?"
- ❌ "What's the current status?"

### After (Autonomous Intelligence)
- ✅ "I can see your dev server running on PID 12345"
- ✅ "TypeScript is clean - safe to proceed"
- ✅ "Build successful (1.2M, 850ms) - ready to deploy"

## ⚡ Lightning-Fast Setup

```bash
# Install globally from npm
npm install -g claude-autonomous-dev

# Initialize in any project  
claude-auto init

# Check what Claude sees
claude-auto status
```

> 🎉 **Now available on npm!** Install globally and use in any project instantly.

**Output:**
```
🤖 CLAUDE AUTO STATUS (45ms)

project     : turbo monorepo (3 workspaces)
frameworks  : astro(1), vite(2), convex(1), react(3)
processes   : Turbo dev (PID: 12345), Astro:4321 (PID: 12346), Convex:3210 (PID: 12347, cloud)
network     : Healthy (astro:4321, vite:5173, convex:3210)
readiness   : 90% (ready)
typescript  : Clean
lint        : 0 errors, 2 warnings
build       : Success (1.2M, 850ms)
git         : 3 files changed
```

## 🛠️ Core Commands

### 🔍 Environment Intelligence
```bash
claude-auto status      # Ultra-fast status (< 50ms)
claude-auto ready       # Comprehensive readiness check
claude-auto scan        # Detailed JSON environment data
claude-auto can-start   # Safe to start servers?
```

### 🔧 Development Tools  
```bash
claude-auto build       # Build monitoring with metrics
claude-auto lint [fix]  # Lint checking with auto-fix
claude-auto fix         # Auto-fix common issues
```

### 🏗️ Monorepo & Framework Support
```bash
claude-auto frameworks          # Detect all frameworks (Astro, Vite, etc.)
claude-auto workspaces          # List monorepo workspaces  
claude-auto workspaces status   # Detailed workspace info
cauto ws                        # Short alias for workspaces
```

### ⚡ Quick Shortcuts
```bash
cauto s                 # Short alias for status
cauto r                 # Short alias for ready  
cauto init && cauto s   # Setup and check
```

## 📊 Live Dashboard Example

```bash
$ claude-auto status

🤖 CLAUDE AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT STATUS
========================================

🎯 Readiness: 85% (Ready)
📡 Dev Server: Running (PID: 65497) ✅
📡 Backend: Running (PID: 65496) ✅  
🔧 TypeScript: Clean (0 errors) ✅
🧹 Lint: 5 warnings (auto-fixable) ⚠️
🏗️ Build: Successful (1.2M, 3.1s) ✅
🌐 Frontend: Healthy (http://localhost:3000) ✅
📝 Git: 4 files changed, ready to commit
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Environmental Scanning
The framework continuously monitors:
- Running processes and their PIDs
- Network endpoints and health status
- Code quality metrics (TypeScript, linting, build status)
- Git repository state
- System resources and performance

### 2. Intelligent Decision Making
Claude can now:
- Avoid starting duplicate servers
- Fix code issues before implementing features
- Choose optimal development workflows
- Predict and prevent common errors

### 3. Autonomous Task Execution
The system enables:
- Self-directed task completion
- Continuous quality validation
- Proactive error correction
- Complete development session logging

- **Error prevention**: Catch issues before they break your flow

### Team Collaboration
- **Shared context**: Environmental snapshots for debugging
- **Remote development**: Distributed teams with unified intelligence
- **Knowledge transfer**: Capture expert workflows for replication

### CI/CD Integration
- **Smart build gates**: Quality-based deployment decisions  
- **Intelligent testing**: Optimize test execution based on code state
- **Predictive monitoring**: Anticipate issues before they occur

claude.addHealthCheck('database', async () => {
  return await checkDatabaseConnection();
});
```
